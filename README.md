### Project Introduction

**TheBigLevy** is the final project for the Financial Engineering course (2024). The primary objectives are to calibrate the parameters of an exponential Lévy model and to price an exotic derivative, as detailed in the file: `project2_MultivariatePricing.pdf`.

### Project Overview

The main focus of this project is to analyze and implement a robust method for multivariate Lévy processes, emphasizing the dependence between components to accurately model financial derivatives. The study is based on the theoretical frameworks and methodologies presented by L. Ballotta and E. Bonfiglioli (2014) and further explores the pricing model implementation and calibration to match market data.

# Methodologies

- **Calibration of Lévy Processes**: The project delves into the calibration of parameters for Lévy processes with Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) marginals, focusing on the S&P 500 and EURO STOXX 50 indices. This involves determining the parameters through various optimization techniques, including RMSE and weighted RMSE approaches.

- **Derivative Pricing**: The pricing of an exotic derivative is conducted using the calibrated Lévy models. The project also compares the Lévy model with a Variance Gamma (VG) subordinator and a traditional Black model to evaluate their effectiveness.

# Files and Resources

- **MATLAB Code**: Contains scripts for the calibration of Lévy processes, including data processing and parameter optimization.

- **Python Code**: Supplementary scripts to support the analysis and validation of the MATLAB code results.

- **Project Report**: A comprehensive document detailing the theoretical framework, methodologies, results, and discussions.
